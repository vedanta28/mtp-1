	abstract = {Delivery drones and ‘air taxis’ are currently among the most intensely discussed emerging technologies, likely to expand mobility into the ‘third dimension’ of low-level airspace. This paper presents a systematic literature review of 111 interdisciplinary publications (2013 - 03/2019). The review systematizes the current socio-technical debate on civil drones for transportation purposes allowing for a (critical) interim assessment. To guide the review process four dimensions of analysis were defined. A total of 2581 relevant quotations were subdivided into anticipated barriers (426), potential problems (1037), proposed solutions (737) and expected benefits (381). We found that the debate is characterized by predominantly technical and regulatory problems and barriers which are considered to prevent or impede the use of drones for parcel and passengers transportation. At the same time, definite economic expectations are juxtaposed with quite complex and differentiated concerns regarding societal and environmental impacts. Scrutinizing the most prevalent transportation-related promises of traffic reduction, travel time saving and environmental relief we found that there is a strong need to provide scientific evidence for the promises linked to the use of drones for transportation. We conclude that the debate on drones for transportation needs further qualification, emphasizing societal benefits and public involvement more strongly.},

There is a rising demand for anti-drone systems, which can detect and block their activities in order to make full use of the great advantages provided by this technology. The project aims to provide a systematic design of a drone detection mechanism using the RF control signal exchanged between the drone and its remote controller. The system generates a high-power jamming signal transmitted over the same carrier frequency and band of the detected drone and directed towards the drone location in order to disconnect it from its controller causing it to land safely or trigger a mechanism to return it to home. This system is designed to work only at 2.4 GHz band.},

	abstract = {Drones, including remotely piloted aircraft or unmanned aerial vehicles, have become extremely appealing over the recent years, with a multitude of applications and usages. However, they can potentially present major threats for security and public safety, especially when they fly across critical infrastructures and public spaces. This work investigates a novel counter-drone solution by proposing a multi-agent framework in which a team of pursuer drones cooperate in order to track and jam a rogue drone. Within the proposed framework, a joint mobility and power control solution is developed to optimize the respective decisions of each cooperating agent in order to best track and intercept the moving rogue drone. Both centralized and distributed variants of the joint optimization problem are developed and extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the problem variants and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.},
